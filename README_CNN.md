📌 Project Description
Handwritten digit recognition plays a vital role in real-world applications like postal mail sorting, bank check processing, and automated form digitization. However, conventional methods often struggle with the diversity in handwriting styles, resulting in inaccuracies. This project focuses on developing a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately classify handwritten digits, enhancing recognition efficiency and minimizing manual effort. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model improves pattern detection and generalization, making it a robust solution for automated handwriting recognition systems in practical applications.

📊 Data Description
This project utilizes the MNIST dataset, a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition. The dataset consists of:

60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
Grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels.
Labels range from 0 to 9, representing different digits.
Well-prepared, preprocessed data, making it ideal for deep learning experiments.
