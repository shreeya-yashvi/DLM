## üèÜ Project Details
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes using a deep learning model built with **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**. The model is trained on a structured dataset containing patient health records, including attributes such as glucose levels, BMI, and insulin. Hyperparameter tuning was emphasized to optimize model performance. The interactive dashboard allows users to modify hyperparameters and observe real-time results.
